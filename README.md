# hello-world
The very first test repository created by me in GitHub.

As you can tell by my user name I really don't like marzipan (check here if you don't know what it is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzipan).
Even though there are many things I hate, I can't say that I am generally a pessimistic hateful person. I'm more of an optimistic cheerful idle activist.
Oh, yeah. I like data analysis :)
